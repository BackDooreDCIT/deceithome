# Installation

To install this extension on Chrome, **you will need to clone this repository.** After you’re done cloning, you will need to **load an unpacked extension** into your Chrome browser.

Don’t know how? Here’s a quick guide.

To load an unpacked extension in developer mode:

1. Go to the Extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions` in a new tab. (By design `chrome://` URLs are not linkable.)
    - Alternatively, click the Extensions menu puzzle button and select **Manage Extensions** at the bottom of the menu.
    - Or, click the Chrome menu, hover over **More Tools,** then select **Extensions**.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the extension directory.
